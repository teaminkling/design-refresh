/**
 * Actions to be performed on state reducers.
 *
 * An action is anything that tells the reducer how to change the global state. As such, this
 * file will rarely need to be edited; only when new types are added.
 *
 * These do not have to match 1-to-1 with each reducer. There may be multiple actions per reducer.
